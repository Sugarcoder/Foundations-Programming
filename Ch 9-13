STYLE GUIDELINES
- Readable
- Consistent
- Accepted best practices



JavaScript Naming Conventions

- Variables & functions = camelcase (lowercase first, uppercase later), other styles is using an underscore between 2 words

- Curly braces = { 
} else {
}


- Define your functions before you call them! 


Simple Rules: 
- Use camelcase
- Open curly brace on the same line
- Define your functions before you call them
- Always use semicolons to end a statement
- Always use 'var' when declaring a variable



PSEUDOCODE 
Pseudocode = Write your instructions in plain English 
- Can you read the pseudocode? Does it make sense?


- Define the structure in the code



DOM = Document Object Model 

Document = web page (one is the browser view, one is the HTML code) 

Object = elements, components, pieces of the document

Model = An agreed-upon set of terms



var headline = document.getElementById("mainHeading")

headline.innerHTML = "Wow, a new headline";



Event handlers or Event listeners = A function that is waiting for an event to happen.


Event handler functions are pre-written terms
Example: onLoad, onClick, onMouseOver, onFocus, onBlur

Ex.
myelement.onclick = function() {
	// your event handler code
};


var headline = document.getElementById("mainHeading")

headline.onclick = function() {
	headline.innerHTML = "You clicked a new headline";
}




Firebug = Free web browser debugger 

- Configure it in Firefox tools ("Web developer")
- Console tab: (enable), Script tab: (enable)



CLASS 
- A blueprint, the definition, the description
- Ex. Restaurant, review, user, textbox, button

- Attributes (aka Properties) = Ex. name, height, weight, gender age
- Behaviors (aka Methods) = walk, run, jump, speak, sleep


- 'Class' is just a description of something
- No need for object unless you are going to make something with it


- One 'class' can creat multiple objects

- Encapsulating classes = self-contained units



OBJECTS 
- Independent of each other
- Has methods and properties 

Ex. 
var myArray = [1,2,3,4,5];
var myRE = /hello/;


Ex.
var today = new Date();
var y2k = new Date(2000,0,1);

today.getMonth();  // returns 0-11 
today.setMonth(5);
today.setDay(0);



PRIMITIVES (only store a value)
Ex. 
var myNumber = 123; 
var isValid = true; 



- Math object is a pre-defined object in JavaScript (can look in javaScript reference guide)



- Use the name of the object when you create it 
- Use a new object based on a class


var myArray = new Array(1,2,3); 
OR
var myArray = [1,2,3,4,5];


- If a class is already coded by someone else, you don't have to write the behavior.
